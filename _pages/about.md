## Project Experience

### [The Analyzer of The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Leader)](https://github.com/EternityPeng/The-Nine-Chapters-Analyzer)  
*02.2024 ¨C 06.2024*  
- Compiled and calculated the results of nine chapters of arithmetic expressions in **Classical Chinese** entered by users.
- Reconstructed and optimized the analysis structure of the lexer and parser, utilizing a **nested set structure** for semantic analysis. This resulted in nearly **70% improvement** in compilation speed.
- Enhanced lookup speed using a **disjoint set (union-find)** structure, supporting **Classical Chinese numerals** conversion to Arabic numerals.

### A Self-aware Computing Model for Autonomous Driving (Ongoing Publication EAAI)  
*03.2024 ¨C Present*  
- Collaborated with [Assoc. Dean Ricky Hou](https://staff.uic.edu.cn/rickyhou/en) to clean datasets and map historical routes using **QGIS**.
- Applied clustering methods to identify anomalous driving behaviors.
