## Project Experience

### [The Analyzer of The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Leader)](https://github.com/EternityPeng/The-Nine-Chapters-Analyzer)  
*02.2024 - 06.2024*  
- Reconstructed and optimized the analysis structure of the lexer and parser, utilizing a **nested set structure** to enhance the semantic analysis phase, particularly the parse tree with **type checking**, enabling the computation of **inverse function** equations and solving complex **multi-query function** problems. This optimization accelerated the **dimensionless and dimensional** analysis as well as the differentiation and conversion between different **basic types, constructed types and other types**, resulting in a nearly **70%** improvement in compilation speed.
  
- Utilized a **disjoint set (union-find)** structure to enhance the lookup speed of the lexeme table and parse table. Additionally, adjusted the **regular expression** matching mechanism to accommodate Classical Chinese characteristics, enabling support for converting Classical Chinese numerals, including **fractions**, to Arabic numerals within a **billion** range, covering **11** types of units across **97** different measurement units.


### A Self-aware Computing Model for Autonomous Driving (Ongoing Publication EAAI)  
*03.2024 - Present*  
- Collaborated with [Assoc. Dean Ricky Hou](https://staff.uic.edu.cn/rickyhou/en) to clean datasets and map historical routes using **QGIS**.
- Applied clustering methods to identify anomalous driving behaviors.

## Internship Experience

### Canvest SciWin Intelligent Company (HKEX-listed), R&D Dept.  
*Data Processing Intern (06.2023 - 09.2023)*  
- Utilized **Unity** for point cloud localization and annotation.
- Prepared anomaly reports and delivered weekly team presentations.
- Assisted in the installation and deployment of **LiDAR** components.
