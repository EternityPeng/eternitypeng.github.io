## Project Experience

### [The Analyzer of The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Leader)](https://github.com/EternityPeng/The-Nine-Chapters-Analyzer)  
*02.2024 - 06.2024*  
- Reconstructed and optimized the analysis structure of the lexer and parser, utilizing a **nested set structure** to enhance the semantic analysis phase, particularly the parse tree with **type checking**, enabling the computation of **inverse function** equations and solving complex **multi-query function** problems. This optimization accelerated the **dimensionless and dimensional** analysis as well as the differentiation and conversion between different **basic types, constructed types and other types**, resulting in a nearly **70%** improvement in compilation speed.
  
- Utilized a **disjoint set (union-find)** structure to enhance the lookup speed of the lexeme table and parse table. Additionally, adjusted the **regular expression** matching mechanism to accommodate Classical Chinese characteristics, enabling support for converting Classical Chinese numerals, including **fractions**, to Arabic numerals within a **billion** range, covering **11** types of units across **97** different measurement units.


### A Self-aware Computing Model for Autonomous Driving (Ongoing Publication EAAI)  
*03.2024 - Present*  
- Collaborated with [Assoc. Dean Ricky Hou](https://staff.uic.edu.cn/rickyhou/en) to clean datasets, subsequently used **QGIS** to map historical **routes and vehicle flow patterns**. 
- Applied different **clustering methods** to identify anomalous driving behaviors.


### [LLM-based Multi-Agent Sales Optimization System](https://github.com/EternityPeng/Customization-of-Multi-Agent-Based-on-Chatdev-Framework)  
*09.2023 - 12.2023*
- Developed an AI-driven multi-agent system using **Large Language Models (LLMs) ChatGPT API** to optimize sales strategies in a simulated marketing environment.
- Implemented agents such as Sales Director, Marketing Strategist, and Sales Specialist, each leveraging **clustering algorithms** and **real-time feedback** to refine sales approaches.
- Achieved a **20% improvement in conversion rates** by **dynamically adjusting** marketing strategies based on client behavior analysis and real-time data.
- Integrated advanced **NLP** and **dimensional analysis** techniques to optimize customer targeting and improve overall ROI.

## Internship Experience

### Canvest SciWin Intelligent Company (HKEX-listed), R&D Dept.  
*Data Processing Intern (06.2023 - 09.2023)*  
- Utilized **Unity** for point cloud localization and annotation, including classification and statistical analysis of vehicle types, driving conditions, heading positions, etc.
- Responsible for preparing anomaly reports and delivering weekly team presentations within the group.
- Assisted in the installation and deployment of **LiDAR** components.
